Given an array of elements, return an array of values pertaining to how many elements are greater than that element remaining in the array.

Brute force is obvious, but must be done faster than O(n^2)

Ex. [3, 4, 5, 9, 2, 1, 3]
Return [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]

First element is 3 because 3< 4, 5, 9. Second element is 2 because 4 < 5, 9. Third number is 1 because 5 < 9. Forth element is 0 because there is no element left that is greater than 9. Fifth element is 1 because 2 < 3. etc.
